# Theory and Empirical Research (TEWA) â€“ Neuroimaging

Teaching material for the TEWA2 seminar at the Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna.

Focus: Reproducable fMRI analysis using Python

## Goals

- Learn the basics of the Python programming language as well as of software libaries commonly used in research (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Get a basic understanding of fMRI preprocessing and analysis. Cave: The goal of the course is *not* necessarily that you will be able to independently perform a full-fledged state-of-the-art fMRI analysis. Rather, we focus on teaching the basics, learning how to get help. All of this as reproducible as possible 
- Becoming familiar with the NiPy framework as well as other neuroimaging software tools
  
## Contents

Besides basic Python scills the main focus lies on the analysis of MRI data, including the basics of...

- Understanding what MRI data is and how it represented on our computers
- Scripting reproducible preprocessing workflows
- Scripting First & Second level analysis 
- Visualizing and reporting results

Specifically, we will cover the following topics:
